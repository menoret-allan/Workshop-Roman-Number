# Roman Numbers

The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M.

The solution already contains a console application, the code logic (Core) and some tests.

For those exercices: All the Core (functional implementation) must have 100% code coverage.

Concentrate to write proper tests, you do not have to complete all the tasks ;)

## First task: decimal to roman

The current implementation is not working properly.

Please write a function to convert from decimal numbers to Roman Numerals.

 * 1 => I
 * 2 => II
 * 3 => III
 * 4 => IV
 * 5 => V
 * 10 => X
 * 3892 => MMMDCCCXCII

## Second task: roman to decimal

Now that you are our expert in roman numbers.

Please write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit.

## Third task: roman calculator

We need to have a roman calculator

 * II + II = IV
 * X + V = XV
